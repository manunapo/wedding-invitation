# Customizable Online Invitation

Online Invitation is a basic, but very nice invitation web page.

You can customize it up to your needs with just changing the images and text content.

I built it and used for my wedding and was a great success :)

### How to customize it ?

The page is made of a simple `HTML` page with `CSS` styles. We can reeplace the images incided in `assets/img`, and some of the text incide that page to get our desired customization.

	It should be really straightforward!

I made a small video showing this steps.

It is prepeared to easily modify some or all of the below items.

- **7 Icons**. 
All the icons size should be 512x512 px and be in PNG format with transparent background. They are named as:
  > icon_**something**.png

- **10 Photos**:
Two are used for the main page and have the following caracteristics:

	> The **photo_background.jpg** should have a size of `1920x1080 px`.

	> The **photo_title.png** should have a size of about `360x440 px` in PNG format with transparent background. 

	The next 8 are used by the gallery, showing some cute images about the couple, family, should be size `600x600px`. And they are named as:

	> 1.jpg, 2.jpg ... 8.jpg

- **Text**.
There are some text field which indicates some information. You should edit it according to your needs.
